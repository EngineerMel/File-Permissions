# File Permissions

Used Linux Commands to Understand How to Assign and Change permission commands for users, groups and others.

## Objective

In this scenario, I needed to examine and manage the permissions on the files in the `/home/researcher2/projects` directory for the `researcher2` user. Since the `researcher2` user is part of the `research_team` group, I needed to check the permissions for all files in the directory, including hidden files, to ensure they match the intended authorization. If any permissions are incorrect, I modified them accordingly.

### Skills Learned

- Using Linux commands to configure authorization for an organization's users.
- Basic Command-Line Navigation (cd, pwd, mkdir, rmdir)
-  File Permissions and Ownership Commands (chmod)

### Tools Used

- Command Line
